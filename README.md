It intends to be a library containing data structures which facilitate pure functional programming in the Scala programming language. Some of these are replacements for structures already present in the Scala standard library, but with improvements in safety, some are data structures for which there is no analogue in the Scala standard library.

### Getting Started

Cats-Collections is currently available under its old name Dogs for Scala 2.11, and 2.12.

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "dogs-core" % "0.6.10"
```
