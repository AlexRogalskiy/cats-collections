## Dogs

This project is intended to be a companion to the
[Cats project](https://github.com/non/cats).

It intents to be a library containing data structures which facilitate
pure functional programming in the Scala programming language. Some of
these are replacements for structures already present in the Scala
standard library, but with improvements in safety, some are data
structures for which there is no analogue in the Scala standard
library.

### EXPERIMENTAL

This project is in its infancy, it should be considered pre-alpha, it
might never go anywhere, it could change drastically along the way if
it does go somewhere.
